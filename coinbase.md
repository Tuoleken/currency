A cryptocurrency scam resulted in charges against a 31-year-old man from Massachusetts. The victim, a 70-year-old resident of Seymour, Connecticut, lost approximately $160,000. The scammers impersonated Coinbase support staff, leading to the victim's loss of around $13.4 million in cryptocurrency. Christopher Abner, the accused, pleaded not guilty to charges related to larceny, identity theft, and money laundering. Legislation has been signed to regulate the cryptocurrency industry in response to similar scams in Connecticut.

During the scam, the victim contacted what they believed was Amazon customer service due to a recurring charge on their bank statement. They were tricked into making deposits at Bitcoin ATMs and setting up a Coinbase account to wire $100,000.

The investigation involved obtaining search warrants for account information and surveillance footage showing Abner withdrawing and laundering the stolen funds.
